# Overview
For the third and the biggest project of the course, we were put in groups of 3 to build a full stack MERN application with CRUD functionality. 

We decided to put some fun into our biggest project so far and build a dating app for our furry friends. After we came up with it’s name, SNIFF, and called ourselves the SNIFFERS, we started designing the app. SNIFF is a fully functioning app where users can register their account, put details of themselves on their profile and use multiple filters and selections to narrow down their search. Once they have the list of potential sniffs based on their criteria, users can view other profiles and start a private chat with them. 

Please note that user authentication is required, anyone interested in viewing the app is welcome to use these credentials scrat@email and password pass.

# Brief:
Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end.
Build and use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
Be a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality and have multiple models.

# Deployment
The app has been deployed with Netlify and is available [here](https://sniff-project-three.netlify.app/).

# Timeframe
7 days

# Goal
To build a full stack application for a dating app with multiple components.

# Technologies Used
* MUI 
* CSS
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* JavaScript
* React
* JWT
* Bcrypt
* Axios
* GitHub

# Process
As a group of 3 coders, while we all actively participated on both back and front end components of the app, we each had parts where we took further responsibility for. 

The main components of the website are the home page which acts as a landing page, login and register pages, index page which shows potential sniffs, and the chat page. 

1. We first started building the back end using Mongoose and MongoDB, then moved on to the front end.

2. On the back end, I focused on building the controllers for the users and chat, and creating functions such as adding, editing, deleting, as well as creating, deleting chat.

3. On the front end, I worked on the home page, navbar, and the chat components. 

4. Styling of the homepage and the responsive navbar with the burger menu was done with a combination of CSS and MUI which is a framework we used for the first time.

5. For the chat components, the important part was extracting the right data, ids and authenticating the user.

6. We wanted users to be able to edit and delete their accounts if they wish to.

7. We also wanted them to be able to delete their messages and eventually the chat itself between themselves and other users. 

8. As a group we were very happy with the filter options we included on the index page. It gave us a great opportunity to work with multiple filters containing different data types. 

# Challenges
* Designing and building a full stack app in 7 days was the biggest challenge so far. While it gave us full control over the app, it was a learning opportunity to build the individual components ourselves. 
* One of minor challenges was being able to use a Cloudinary account for the images users upload upon registering their accounts. We had some issues with this and ended up cropping the images we were to upload manually. 
* We realised that MUI components weren’t always the most practical to use so we used a combination of MUI and CSS.

# Wins
* Having our work planned per each day helped us stick to a plan and remain focused even when we were facing challenges.
* Working as a part of a group and supporting each other throughout the stages was very valuable.
* Reaching our MVP within the project timeframe and having a strong user journey was our desired outcome.

# Future improvements
* On the index page I would like to be able to fix the varied profile card heights and have them all unified. 
* I would like to implement a functionality where the users can ‘favourite’ their potential Sniffers and have them on a list.
* Adding further error handling.
